# Fun Stuff!

This is a few small project for fun.

## Seven Star Women's Kung Fu - Combo Generator

Visit [https://anybodys.github.io/](https://anybodys.github.io/) to use the combo generator. This is a self-training or teacher support tool to generate combos for practice.

See also the [Android App version](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.anybodys.kajukenbo) because I wanted to try out Kotlin and React. üòÅ
This repo is private but may become public at some point. Please feel free to reach out if you'd like to contribute!
Since I am learning Android development, Kotlin, and React, it's not the prettiest repo.
The Android App also contains a forms generator, picking both a form and style to practice it in. (E.g., "Kata 2 for clarity of technique".)

## Dawgbytes Summer Camp - mini JS animations

I have a little animation of a starry night [here](https://anybodys.github.io/dawgbytes_index.html). This was a demo from a Summer Camp I taught for
[UW Allen School's DawgBytes program](https://news.cs.washington.edu/2017/07/19/allen-schools-dawgbytes-summer-camps-are-in-full-swing/).
